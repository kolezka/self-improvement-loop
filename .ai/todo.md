# self-improvement-loop v2 (TypeScript + Bun): build plan

Design: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. The interim Python V2 was the port source and is
gone from the tree (last Python commit 97d8b42).

## Phase 0: contracts
- [x] monorepo: workspaces, tsconfig, bunfig, scripts/build.ts (committed dist/ + srchash), scripts/lint-dashes.ts
- [x] @sil/core, @sil/store with tests; typed stubs for the rest; apps/web skeleton

## Phase 1: parallel port
- [x] A @sil/nudges + apps/hook (bundle, exit 0 always, 14 ms p50)
- [x] B @sil/transcript, providers, critic, feedback, worker (+ outline export)
- [x] C @sil/curriculum (git, artifacts, lint, router, prompts, plan, run) + @sil/review
- [x] D @sil/ops + apps/server (Bun.serve) + apps/web (Svelte 5, 9 panes)
- [x] E apps/cli (commander), schedule, importer, hooks.json -> dist/hook.js, commands, docs, scripts/sil

## Phase 2: integration
- [x] bun install, typecheck, bun test green (699 pass, 51 files)
- [x] bun run build; dist drift test; hooks.json points at dist/hook.js
- [x] tests/e2e.test.ts: hook bundle -> queue -> worker (fake chat) -> reflection -> inbox -> SessionStart; reflections -> run -> review -> accept -> relink; HTTP API
- [x] browser smoke of the Svelte UI (Overview, Review detail + diff, Accept)
- [x] independent review (hook, curriculum/review, web security); all blockers fixed in a7d0e41
- [x] Python tree removed, docs updated
- [x] commits on feat/loop-v2

## Phase 3: hand-off (operator)
- [ ] decide repo visibility (GitHub repo is PUBLIC today), push the local commits
- [ ] run scripts/register-marketplace.sh and open the marketplace PR
- [ ] `sil init`, point llm.yaml at the LiteLLM proxy, optionally add a V1-layout world for dotfiles-next

## Known limits
- A lint-clean regex gate is still bounded only by JavaScriptCore's backtracking cap inside one hook call; the out of process runner covers the curriculum side.
- The worker lock is a pid file, not flock; the reclaim has a documented 60 ms window.
- `remote: pr` is implemented against `gh` but not exercised against GitHub; Outline export untested against a live server.
- Reviews ran on Claude models only; no second model family was available in this session.
